## üëã Hi there, I'm Mahsa Ileslamlou! 
üéì Junior at UCLA, studying Mathematics of Computation

I'm currently particpating in the [BreakThroughTech](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/) program at the UCLA site in which I was selected as one of **250/3000+** applicants to particpate in a 12-month long program including Machine Learning coursework!

I am very interested in exploring the intersection of human behavior and technology, particularly within the entertainment industry. I want to focus on enhancing the human experience by analyzing data to understand what qualities make something appealing. I aim to work on projects where I can analyze and identify patterns to help develop more personalized technologies for everyone!

## üéØ Projects
**[DirecTV]: [Next-Gen TV Show Recommendation](https://github.com/DirecTV-Team1A-NextGen-Rec/directv_tvrec.git) (Break Through Tech AI Program)**
- Check out my team's project repository for the real-world ML project we worked on for DirecTV for over 4 months, as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program's Fall 2024 AI Studio!
- **What we did**: Preprocessed an IMDb dataset with over **150,000 entries**, handled missing values, and one-hot encoded categorical features. We used **BERT** for text processing and sentiment analysis and built and fine-tuned several models (**Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**) to predict TV show popularity.
- **Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, NLP, BERT, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost
- **Result**:  
  - **Linear Regression**: RMSE: 0.1830, MAE: 0.1276, R¬≤: 0.6077 (underfitting)  
  - **Random Forest**: RMSE: 0.1639, MAE: 0.1042, R¬≤: 0.6452 (slight overfitting)  
  - **Gradient Boosting**: RMSE: 0.1699, MAE: 0.1111, R¬≤: 0.6620 (high performance, computationally intensive)  
  - **XGBoost**: RMSE: 0.1483, MAE: 0.0800, R¬≤: 0.7067 (best performance, less interpretable)  
  - **CatBoost**: RMSE: 0.1549, MAE: 0.0240, R¬≤: 0.7185 (excellent for categorical features, harder to interpret)
